# hockey-sched
A set of scripts to create a hockey league game schedule.  This is so specific to the one league/rink I threw it together for, 
it won't be of use to anyone else.  And the code is just thrown together, I'm not taking the time to write it nicely.  It's only
on github so it's under version control.
